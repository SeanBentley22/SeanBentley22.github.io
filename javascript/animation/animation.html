				<!-- SVG -->

				<div class="text">
					<h2> SVG </h2>
					<ul>
						<li> SVG elements are as interactive as normal HTML Elements because every shape we make has an underlying object in the DOM. </li>
						<li> We can make a basic animation simply by modifying some property of an SVG element via the recursive callback function we pass into requestAnimationFrame(). </li>
						<li> We could alternatively use CSS Animations instead of Javascipt's requestAnimationFrame() in most cases, as well. </li>
					</ul>
					<button id="switch" type="button"> Animate </button>
				</div>

				<div class="graphic">

				      <svg width="250" height="275">
				      	<rect x="105" y="0" width="40" height="10" fill="black"></rect>
				        <path d="M 125 10 V 15" stroke="black"></path>
	        			<rect id="grab" x="115" y="15" width="20" height="20" fill="blue"></rect>
	      			  </svg>

	      		</div>


	      		<!-- Canvas -->

					<div class="text">
						<h2> Canvas </h2>
						<ul>
							<li> Crucially, shapes drawn to the canvas have no underlying object in the DOM. They are just pixels painted to the screen. There's no way to reference them afterwards. It means that,
								<ol>
									<li> We can't use CSS animations (i.e. keyframing properties), and must use requestAnimationFrame()</li>
									<li>
										We probably want to clear the canvas before updating the screen with a new drawing, using a function such as clearRect(). That is, we can't just modify a property like we did when using SVG. All the pixels painted during the last repaint would otherwise remain on the screen.
									</li>
								</ol>
							<li> Because of the necessity of clearing everything before you redraw, we likely wouldn't pick Canvas if we had some animation that only moved one small part of a very big drawing. SVG would usually be more suitable in that case. </li>
							<li>
								However, because shapes we draw in canvas don't have to go through the extra work of becoming objects in the DOM, with their a data saved and a reference to them available, if we have an animation involving lots of tiny moving shapes, we could be better off using Canvas.
							</li>
